## How It Works

1. **Step-by-Step Questions:**  
   The system asks the following questions to understand your requirements:
   - What type of category do you want?
   - Who is the author you prefer?
   - Tell me the topics related to the category you would like to refer to. It will help find the most suitable books.
   - How much book rating do you hope to find (e.g., 4.1 or 4.5)?
   - How about the target audience, like teens or adults?
   - Which type of book do you hope for, like a novel or hardcover?
   - Which language do you prefer for the book?

2. **User Inputs:**  
   Based on your responses:
   - Categories and authors are matched directly.
   - Keywords are analyzed for relevance.
   - Ratings are filtered with a tolerance of Â±0.5.

3. **Inference Engine:**  
   - The `experta` library manages the rules and facts to process user inputs and recommend books.
   - Rules are designed to handle:
     - Exact matches
     - Partial matches (with relevance scores)
     - Suggestions for similar authors and topics
   - Uses **forward chaining** to infer results based on facts provided by the user.

4. **Response Generation:**  
   The system provides:
   - Books matching your exact preferences (if available).
   - Alternatives with relevance scores.
   - Additional recommendations considering unspecified preferences.
